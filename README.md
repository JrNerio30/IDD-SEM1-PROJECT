### About Portfolio

This is my [Portfolio](https://jrnerio30.github.io/Portfolio/) and it's my first website/ personal project.
And with this project, I am confident and ready to get my hands dirty on creating many more projects in the future.

I've learned:
* I've learned how to create a parallax image/background which I was very proud of.
* I've learned how to properly organize HTML5 using the semantic elements, CSS, and a little bit of Javascript.
* Many kinds of elements and syntaxes of HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
* Web Designing
* The accessibility and the interactivity of Websites.
* JavaScript posed a significant challenge for me during the creation of this project. Initially, I found it challenging, but as I delved deeper into coding and actively engaged with the material, I overcame my initial difficulties. Incrementally building the code and immersing myself in hands-on practice allowed me to break through my weaknesses. 

ðŸ«€I am committed to further enhancing my understanding of HTML, CSS, and Javascript and continuously strengthening my skills as a Web Developer.
