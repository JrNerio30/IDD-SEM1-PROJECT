### About Portfolio

This is my [Portfolio](https://jrnerio30.github.io/Portfolio/) and it's my first website/ personal project.
And with this project, I'am confident and ready to get my hands dirty on creating many more projects in the future.

I've learned:
* Many kinds of elemts and syntaxes of HTML, CSS, Javascript
* Web Designing
* The accessibility and the interactivity of Websites
* JavaScript posed a significant challenge for me during the creation of this project. Initially, I found it challenging, but as I delved deeper into coding and actively engaged with the material, I overcame my initial difficulties. Incrementally building the code and immersing myself in hands-on practice allowed me to break through my weaknesses. 

I am committed to further enhancing my understanding of HTML, CSS, Javascript and continuously strengthening my skills as a Web Developer.
